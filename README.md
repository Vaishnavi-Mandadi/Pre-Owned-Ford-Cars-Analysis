# **Pre-Owned Ford Cars Price Prediction**

## **Overview**
This project presents a linear regression model to predict the price of pre-owned Ford cars. The analysis is based on a dataset encompassing various factors that could influence the resale value of Ford vehicles.

## **Dataset**
The dataset consists of 1000 entries, featuring one dependent variable (Price) and seven independent variables, including year, model, transmission, fuel type, and others. The data range from 2013 to 2020, with detailed categorization into 18 models, 3 transmission types, and 3 fuel types, resulting in 24 dummy variables.

## **Key Objectives**
To understand how different variables affect the price of pre-owned Ford cars.
To develop an accurate linear regression model for future price prediction.
To provide insights for both buyers and sellers in the pre-owned car market.

## **Methodology**
Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality with no errors or missing values.
Linear Regression Model: Implemented using SPSS, the model predicts car prices based on various features.
Analytical Tools: SPSS for regression analysis.

## **Results**
The model achieved an R-square of 86.1%, indicating a strong fit.
Significant variables affecting the price were identified, such as the car model, MPG, miles traveled, etc.
The analysis revealed trends like the correlation between MPG and price, and the impact of the car's year on its price.

## **Observations**
The high R-square value suggests reliability, but the addition of more external factors could enhance the model.
Exploration of variables' correlation (positive and negative) with the price.
Insights from bar graphs showing relationships between selected variables.

## **Prescriptive Analysis**
The analysis provides recommendations on factors like MPG, transmission, and fuel type for increasing sales.
Predictions on popular models based on current trends.

## **Conclusion**
The project successfully demonstrates the use of linear regression in predicting pre-owned car prices.
Identification of significant models and trends beneficial for market stakeholders.
